    <p>
      This chocolate cake is made with cocoa and hot coffee. It has been in my
      family forever. The secret is to not overbake it â€” that will ruin a
      chocolate cake every time.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 cups white sugar</li>

      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the over to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a
        9x13-inch baking pan
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, stir together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, and
        baking soda. Add oil, milk, eggs, and vanilla; mix until smooth. Stir in
        hot coffee last. Spread evenly into the prepared pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick
        inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Cool in the pan
        for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.
